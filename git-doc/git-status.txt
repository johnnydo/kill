Git status

Each file in our working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked.
- Tracked files can be unmodified, modified or staged.
- Untracked files are everything else.

- When you first clone a repository, all of your file will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven't edited anything.
- As you edit files, Git sees them as modified because you've changed them since your last commit.
- You stage these modified files and then commit all your staged changes, and the cycle repeats.

$ git status // checking the status of our files, determine which files are in which state
$ git add README // tracking the README file
$ git commit -m "message content" // commit our changes
// if you're on branch master, your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit. Publish to our local commits:
$ git push

// to remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your traked files (remove it from tracking area) and then commit
$ rm projects.md
